# CSharp Development

I've started this repository to make me more comfortable in Learning C# Stepwise, using examples of code.
I'm using my free time to update this repository with the concepts of C#. Once after covering all the concepts, I will use this repository as a reference for developing projects on C# & .NET Framework.
